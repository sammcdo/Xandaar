# Xandaar
A Space Invaders clone written in python

Based off of the game _Alien Invasion_ created in the book [Python Crash Course](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_2e/).

I wrote this in 2018 I think after reading Python Crash Course. I added levels, and more aliens as well as making it side-scrolling instead of vertical. The background music was made with [Garage Band](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/garageband/id408709785). It was a pretty fun project to make. No guarantee that it is 100% error free. ;)
